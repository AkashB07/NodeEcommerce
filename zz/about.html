            <p>Scorpion is the fifth studio album by Canadian rapper and singer Drake.
                It was released on June 29, 2018, by Cash Money Records, Republic Records,
                 and Young Money Entertainment. Scorpion is a double album consisting of 25
                  tracks. Its first disc is primarily hip hop, while its second disc has been 
                  described as R&B and pop. It was executively produced by Drake himself, a
                  longside frequent collaborator 40 and manager Oliver El-Khatib. Scorpion features
                   guest appearances from Jay-Z and Ty Dolla Sign, as well as posthumous appearances
                    from Michael Jackson and Static Major.</p>
                    <P>
                        Lyrically, the album sees Drake rap about topics that have been common in his 
                        discography, including claustrophobia, relationships, and boasting about his 
                        rise from underdog to a prominent figure in music. The production draws influence
                         from a range of genres, including soul, ambience, quiet storm, R&B, pop, 
                         electronica, and trap.
                    </P>
