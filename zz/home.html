            <p>Scorpion is the fifth studio album by Canadian rapper and singer Drake.
                It was released on June 29, 2018, by Cash Money Records, Republic Records,
                 and Young Money Entertainment. Scorpion is a double album consisting of 25
                  tracks. Its first disc is primarily hip hop, while its second disc has been 
                  described as R&B and pop. It was executively produced by Drake himself, a
                  longside frequent collaborator 40 and manager Oliver El-Khatib. Scorpion features
                   guest appearances from Jay-Z and Ty Dolla Sign, as well as posthumous appearances
                    from Michael Jackson and Static Major.
                Lyrically, the album sees Drake rap about topics that have been common in 
                his discography, including claustrophobia, relationships, and boasting about 
                his rise from underdog to a prominent figure in music. The production draws i
                nfluence from a range of genres, including soul, ambience, quiet storm, R&B, 
                pop, electronica, and trap.
                
                Scorpion was supported by the singles "God's Plan", "Nice for What", "I'm Upset",
                 "Don't Matter to Me", "In My Feelings", "Nonstop", and "Mob Ties". All seven singles 
                 reached the top twenty on the US Billboard Hot 100, with three of them reaching number
                  one: "God's Plan", "Nice for What", and "In My Feelings". In its first day of release, 
                  Scorpion broke Spotify's one-day global record for album streams with 132.45 million streams.
                   It also broke Apple Music's single-day record with 170 million streams, breaking Drake's own 
                   record set with More Life.
                
                Scorpion received lukewarm reviews from critics, with praise directed at the quality 
                of its tracks but criticism directed at the album's length as a whole. Despite this, 
                it performed well commercially, debuting atop the US Billboard 200 with 732,000 
                album-equivalent units, of which 160,000 came from pure sales. As of January 2019, 
                Scorpion was certified five times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of
                America (RIAA). The album received five nominations at the 2019 Grammy Awards, including A
                lbum of the Year, and "God's Plan" won Best Rap Song. The album also won Drake a second 
                Top Billboard 200 Album of his career at the 2019 Billboard Music Awards, among other awards.</p>
